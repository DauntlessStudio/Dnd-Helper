Project is split into 3 panels.

1st panel (vertical on the left): contains a dice roller, left clicking a dice icon adds its roll to the total, right
clicking removes the roll. Clicking on the result clears it.

2nd panel (horizontal on the right upper): the primary game panel, contents can be tabbed between. Some options are:
- combat panel: contains a grid with tokens representing the players and enemies. Quick placement for new players an
enemies. The panel subdivides into the primary grid and a stack of combatents in the order of initiative. Selecting a
grid token or a combatent grid icon brings up a more detailed modal window with extra info; displaying the HP, stats, 
attacks, conditions, force/tech points, and powers (powers will have helper options for applying damage etc.). The
NPCs HP can be modified from the token, side panel, or detail window.
- rules quick reference panel: contains several links to simplified reminders on the rules of traversal, combat, 
conditions, etc.
- equipment panel: contains a searchable list of items, both homebrewed and from the source books.
- generators: generators for names, random events, locations, npcs etc.

3rd panel (horizontal on the right lower): the notes panel. Allows for quick note taking. Ideally this would allow
some kind of integration with ObsidianMD.
