The gigantic creature is protected by a hard, shell-like carapace of bony nodules. They walk on six hardened, skin-covered claws, and have grappling hands. Its mouth is filled with razor-sharp teeth, and uses an organ beneath its chin to sense the electricical field given off by its prey, which it then spears with its pointed legs. The species has stretchy stomachs and three eyes."
