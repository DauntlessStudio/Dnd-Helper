flavorText = "The All Terrain Scout Transport (or AT-ST), also known as the chicken walker for its two-legged design, is a bipedal walker used by the Galactic Republic during the late Clone Wars and, later and more extensively, by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War.AT-STs are commonly used to screen the flanks of larger assault walkers for major ground operations. The Empire used them for swift reconnaissance and troop support. As such, they are essential for cleaning up minor resistance along the path of a planned invasion route, and can quickly eliminate small threats that evade an AT-AT's barrage. The walker is commonly used on anti-personnel hunting missions, and is piloted by two AT-ST drivers.Despite its speed and agility, an AT-ST walker's offensive and defensive power are significantly compromised. Offensively, its weapons systems are only good against lightly armored targets at close range. Defensively, its lighter armor can repel attacks from small-arms fire, but not laser cannons, missiles, or other heavy ordnance. Its armor does not cover its entire frame, lest the walker lose its agility. Striking the walker's unprotected gyros underneath the command module can destabilize the walker and cause it to fall. Additionally, deep trenches or cable lines leveled at the height of the AT-ST's ankles and knees can cause it to trip and topple the vehicle.The modular design of the AT-ST allows for ease in customizing the walker with armaments and tools for specific mission parameters such as mortar launchers attached to the command pod."
