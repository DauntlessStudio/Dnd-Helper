sectionText = "The Battle Hydra is a type of large reptilian dragon-like Sithspawn that was created by the Sith Lord Exar Kun. They are known to have two heads that sit atop long, fluid necks. The heads hold a pair of yellow slitted eyes. There were some varieties of these beasts that have more than two heads.***Behavior.*** When left to their own devices, these beasts are mindless and shy creatures-a sharp contrast to their fearsome appearance. Battle hydras are known to be solitary animals that hunt alone. They spend most time aloft where they ride thermal currents in search of prey or threats. When prey is spotted, the battle hydra dives through the air, snapping with multiple jaws as well as their poisoned stinger. Once prey succumbs to either the attack or poison, the beast takes the corpse back to its lair where it is torn apart and devoured. These animals are, however, susceptible to influence or commands from Force-sensitive dark side users. Many of battle hydras have been used as personal shocktroopers for these dark-lords. Battle hydras are known to be particularly attracted to sites that are strong in the dark side of the Force. It is believed that perhaps these beasts draw some form of nourishment from these locations."
