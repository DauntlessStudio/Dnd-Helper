Equipped with a stealth field generator, they were perfectly designed for espionage.They had the same operating abilities as B1 battle droids, with the addition of infiltration software. This, along with their humanoid shape, gave them the unique ability to fit into human-sized armor. In addition to this, the droids were capable of modulating their voices to match that of others, though they could not accurately copy their mannerisms or vocabulary, nor respond properly to unexpected situations outside of combatBX-series droid commandos were designed to accomplish tasks that an overwhelming force of droids could not. They were capable of hand-to-hand combat, had greater accuracy than their B1 predecessors. "
sectionText = "Battle droids, also known as combat droids or battle bots, are a type of droid designed for combat. One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.***Clone Wars.*** Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire."
