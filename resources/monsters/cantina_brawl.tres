sectionText = "A cantina, also known as a saloon, bar, or pub is a place where spacers, smugglers, and other denizens of the nearby area come to drink and play board and card games, such as pazaak or sabacc. Cantinas are located on almost every major planet and are often a center of criminal activity such as smuggling and spice trading. Many cantinas provid live entertainment in the form of musicians, dancers, or fighters. Gambling is also popular in these locales. The main attractions, however, are the beverages served by mixologists or automixers, and the opportunity to meet friends or business associates (illicit or otherwise).Cantinas are generally poorly lit and crowded. They are dangerous centers of criminal activity, and it is not uncommon for patrons to be maimed or killed within the walls, without so much as a flinch from the staff or the other patrons.  Sometimes, however, things can get out of hand."
