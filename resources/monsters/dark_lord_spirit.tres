flavorText = "Some incredibly powerful dark force users can bind themselves to a location and physcially manifest and remain incredibly potent over a limited geographic area, such as a cave, copse, or abandoned city.  This location is their lair.#### Lair ActionsOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a Dark Lord Spirit can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:- Dark Lord Spirit casts the *coerce mind* power on every creature of his choice in the lair.  It needn't see each one, but it must be aware that an individual is in the lair to target that creature. It issues the same command to all the targets.- Dark Lord Spirit casts the *darness* power four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the power.  It doesn't need to concentrate on the powers, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round.#### Regional Effects- The area within 6 miles of the lair becomes overpopulated with lizards, poisonous snakes, and other venoumous beasts.- Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become violent and crazed -- even creatures that are normally docile.- Intelligent creatures within half of a mile of the lair frequently see hallucinations of long-dead friends and comrades that vanish after only a brief glimpse.If the Dark Lord Spirit dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days."
sectionText = "While most Jedi would lose their solid form and become one with the Force upon their death, some had learned a technique to retain their own identities separate from the Force for a time. Those individuals could linger in the physical world in the form of \"Force Spirits,\" nonphysical entities that exhibited most traits and abilities they had in life. According to the knowledge contained in Asli Krimsan's holocron, that feat could be achieved by sublimating one's organic cells into a state of pure energy.In its \"normal\" state, a Force Spirit could only interact with other noncorporeal entities. In order to be heard or seen by the living, the Spirit had to manifest itself. There were different types of manifestation. On a basic level, a Force ghost could appear as a floating, milky gray mass of energy that lacked distinctive features. But it could also manifest itself as the exact image of the dead being during their lifetime, only transparent and emitting a bluish glow. While it could appear to anyone it wished, a spirit could not choose to become audible or visible to only some beings and not the others, since the ability to perceive the manifestation depended on the beholder's strength in the Force. While many Force ghosts could appear as a vision of their former selves unmarked by injury or disease, others still bore the marks of what killed them. Normally, force spirits could neither harm nor be harmed by physical entities, due to their spiritual nature. For the same reason, they could pass through solid matter effortlessly and were never hampered in their movements. While some spirits would simulate the walk of the living beings, subject to gravity, others would hover and drift above ground level. However, in some cases, a spirit could acquire temporary solidity by drawing on a living creature's link with the Force, which allowed it to actually touch the material world for a time. A manifested spirit could wield Force powers, although not all of them. It also had the ability to travel instantaneously to any point in the galaxy by force of will, as long as the spirit was familiar with that place. "
