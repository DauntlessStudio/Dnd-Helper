sectionText = "Death troopers were an elite variant of stormtroopers designed for stealth, espionage and lethality. Operating under Imperial Intelligence, they served as protective details and bodyguards for significant Imperial officers as well as special-assignment commandos. Death troopers were trained in unarmed combat, heavy weapons, demolitions, and marksmanship. They were experts at covering their tracks, leaving little to no evidence of their missions.Stormtrooper candidates who excelled at their training were reassigned to the advanced death trooper camp on Scarif. They were required to exceed traditional stormtrooper standards, including height and weight, and had to meet certain ideological standards. The candidates were also subjected to a battery of physical tests and classified surgical enhancements as well as more rigorous training than standard stormtroopers. They wore black suits of armor that was much more advanced than standard stormtrooper armor. Their helmet had vocal scramblers, micro-motion sensors, targeting systems, and heads-up displays with data on enemy and friendly positions on the battlefield to give them total situational awareness. Their armor was also covered by a spray polymer called reflec, which warped electromagnetic signals commonly found in sensor arrays, making them well suited for stealth operations. Death troopers were equipped with a variety of weapons depending on their specialities including the SE-14r light repeating blasters, E-11Ds, DLT-19D heavy blaster rifles, C-25 fragmentation grenades and Sonic Imploders."
