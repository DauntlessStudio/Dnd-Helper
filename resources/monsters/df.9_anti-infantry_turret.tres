flavorText = "Manufactured by Golan Arms, the DF.9 is a fixed emplacement anti-infantry weapon. It incorporates a single DF.9 laser cannon mounted atop a four-meter tall cylindrical housing composed of heavily-armored durasteel, with proton-shielding that is resistant to close-quarters blaster fire. The tower features a front access panel, and an upper observation hatch.The turreted laser cannon employs precision targeting computers and has an optimal rang of three kilometers, although the laser cannon is capable of hitting targets at a distance of sixteen kilometers at the cost of decreased accuracy. The DF.9 is capable of firing a shot every three seconds, with the impact of the energy beam scattering explosive energy and producing a secondary blast of radiation with an eight-meter radius impact point that can effectively destroy entire squads of soldiers. Skilled gunners can use the DF.9's accuracy to effectively disable army support systems and light vehicles, and it is devastating to foot soldiers and a threat to vehicles such as the All Terrain Scout Transport.The DF.9 is best used in conjunction with other similar units and anti-vehicle lasers to defend military bases, spaceports and other strategic installations. It can be installed on multiple terrain types. The nature of the DF.9's fixed emplacement means that the unit is not able to be moved easily."
sectionText = "A turret is a mount for a weapon that enabled it to turn and pivot, allowing it to fire in many different directions. They are mounted on many vehicles, starfighters, and starships.  Other turrets are mounted on the ground, and can be both manned and un-manned. Weapons mounted on turrets included laser cannons and other types of projectile cannons."
