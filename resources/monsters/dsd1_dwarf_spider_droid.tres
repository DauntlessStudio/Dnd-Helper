name = "DSD1 Dwarf Spider Droid"
flavorText = "The DSD1 dwarf spider droid, also known as the burrowing spider droid because it was first used to destroy opposition in narrow mine shafts, is a battle droid manufactured by the Commerce Guild to support the cause of the Separatists, and also used to punish customers who decline to pay their taxes to the Commerce Guild.***Characteristics.*** The DSD1 is similar in function to a typical combat vehicle. Its main weapon is a long central blaster cannon mounted on its dome that is capable of firing either rapid anti-personnel rounds, or slower high-intensity blasts that can destroy light vehicles. The droid's small frame and four all-terrain legs make it suitable for warfare in dangerous mines, and the adjustable legs lets it attain better elevation for the blaster cannon. Its legs are able to walk straight up and down walls and narrow cliffsides. However, because of the fixed laser cannon, it can not turn around to track enemies, thus making it inferior to speedy targets. Also, the length of this cannon sometimes hinders it in confined areas.***Behavior.*** The droid communicates in a beeping language similar to Binary. It seems to have basic emotions, such as frustration. They do not do anything that they predict will harm themselves.***After the Clone Wars.***  Though most Separatist war vehicles were deactivated after the end of the Clone Wars, the dwarf spider droids were recommissioned through Imperial command and used by the Galactic Empire to enforce the submission of former Separatist worlds, fighting against the remnants of the very government that once used them, with the Stormtrooper Corps using the droids as their mechanical attack dogs. They would remain utilized throughout the Empire's reign, and it was not uncommon to see these droids alongside stormtroopers at Imperial checkpoints."
sectionText = "Battle droids, also known as combat droids or battle bots, are a type of droid designed for combat. One thing most battle droids have in common is limited intelligence. They are programmed to follow orders, and not much else, though they do have personalities. Some battle droids, however, have some form of intelligence. These droids are much more expensive to make, due to their advanced brains.***Clone Wars.*** Over the years, many different models of battle droid have been utilized by various factions throughout the galaxy. The Confederacy of Independent Systems, for example, used a number of different models of battle droid during the Clone Wars to make up the Separatist Droid Army. Under the command of General Grievous, varying models of battle droid fought against the Galactic Republic's clone troopers until the final days of the war, when the Confederate battle droids were deactivated by the Galactic Empire."
