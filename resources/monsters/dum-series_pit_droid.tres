In the center of their head is a large, round photoreceptor equipped with multi-spectrum scanners capable of detecting microscopic damage. Pit droids stand 1.19 meters tall but can compress themselves into a compact, box-shaped package. A tap on their photorecepter signals them to return to their upright position, and vice-versa. Their most remarkable feature is their immense strength, able to carry objects many times their own size or weight.  "
