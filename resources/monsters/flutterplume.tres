The enormous scavenger bird was noted for its impressive hook-like beak and four sets of curled talons that it used to tear apart and consume rotting carcasses. Its beautiful feathers were also valued as good luck charms. An abundant supply of fresh battlefield kills attracted flocks of these carrion eaters and there were stories of wounded men unable to defend them-selves being eaten by the hungry winged predators. Flutterplumes hunted in flocks of three or four, gliding on the thermal currents that blew across the planet"
