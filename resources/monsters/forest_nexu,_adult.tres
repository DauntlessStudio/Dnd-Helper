They are also found on Zhanox.***Biology & Appearance.*** There are other breeds of nexu on Cholganna's other continents, but only the forest nexu has an additional set of eyes able to view in infrared wavelength, which aid in their hunting of bark rats and tree-climbing octopi. Nexu are 4.5 meters long and generally 1 meter tall.The nexu has claws which can slice a Human in half. They have quills along their back, and a long tail that allows the nexu to swing from tree branch to tree branch. The tail also splits into two equal sections for a better grip on the tree branch they are swinging from. They have extremely sharp instincts and reflexes, although they are known to tire easily, and often use swift movements to finish an enemy quickly, biting down and thrashing their head about to break their victim's neck. Cubs are born pure white.The black nexu is particularly stealthy and rare."
