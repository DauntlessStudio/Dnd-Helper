sectionText = "Power droids are boxy droids with two or four legs that serve as mobile batteries, capable of powering a variety of machinery and vehicles. They are, effectively, power generators with legs and simple artificial intelligence so that they can understand rudimentary commands. They are most commonly found on under-developed worlds that do not have an expansive power grid, or in mobile (often military) operations.They often make a low honking noise that sounds like the word \"gonk,\" resulting in the nickname gonk droid or simply gonk. This form of droidspeak was referred to as \"Gonkian.\"***Models.*** Notable power droid models included the EG-4 and EG-6 power droids produced by Veril Line Systems; the S9-series heavy power droid, a larger and more powerful version of the EG-6; the PLNK \"plunk\" power droid; and the popular GNK power droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton."
