sectionText = "Gorax were a species of seldom-seen giant humanoids native to the mountains of Endor. They sometimes attacked the villages of the Ewoks, who were among the sentient inhabitants of the moon.***Biology & Appearance.*** Adult Gorax were usually over six meters tall. Some specimens were recorded that were up to 30 meters in height. A Gorax's ocher skin is covered in thick, matted dark fur, except on the face, hands and feet. Its head features two forward-facing eyes with bushy brows, a mouth full of sharp fangs, and slit nostrils. Its limbs terminate in four fingers, including an opposable thumb. All of these digits end in sharp nails. However, some variants are known to have three-fingered hands, and feet with two large toes. Their large ponted ears offered them a highly sensitive hearing.Gorax have immense strength; they are capable of uprooting a large tree effortlessly with both hands.***Behavior.*** Gorax live in mountainous areas and rarely show themselves. Although they mostly behave like savage animals, they display a capacity to use objects as crude toolsï¿½for example, using an uprooted tree as a blunt weapon. Moreover, some wear crude pieces of clothing, like a sash made of furs and skulls, or a belted loincloth."
