sectionText = "Hutts are a large slug-like sentient species native to the planet Nal Hutta. They are well known as galactic gangsters whose Grand Hutt Council controlls the Hutt Clan crime syndicate. ***Biology & Appearance.*** Hutts have large mouths, stubby arms, and three lungs. They are tough and muscular with thick leathery skin, which is wrinkled and slimy.  Their tails are supported by a skeletal spine. Despite their legendary adult size, Hutts start out as tiny Huttlets less than half a meter in height.Their homeworld of Nal Hutta has a hot atmosphere and is frequently streaked by greasy rains, creating a fetid sauna in which Hutts are most comfortable. Hutts can live for centuriesï¿½Jabba was 604 when he was killedï¿½and can grow to enormous sizes.Some Hutts suffer from a genetic defect that causes their skin to be bereft of pigment and prone to cracking.***Culture.*** Most Hutts are crime lords who live opulent lives overseeing criminal underworld activities like smuggling, slavery, gambling and bounty hunting in Hutt Space. They are typically obese, with the muscular Nar Shaddaa kingpin Grakkus being an exception.The Hutt Clan is divided into families known as kajidics: Jabba's family was the Desilijic kajidic. Hutts bandage and bury their dead. Classical architectural Hutt style can be seen on the planet Mataou. It is characterized by terraced buildings with sloping gates, and white and red colors.Clothing is optional for Hutts, and some use live Sha'rellian toops as hairpieces. Hutts like to eat gorgs, slime pods and Klatooine paddy frogs, and are known to smoke hookah pipes.Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu was a Hutt who ascended to godhood. To celebrate the deity's ascension, the celebration of Boonta Eve was created. "
