The Hyena bomber also was used as a fighter, but only when needed.  The Hyena-class bomber is similar in design to the Vulture-class fighter, but has a broader fuselage and two \"head\" units. Unlike the Vulture Droid, the Hyena bomber's wings separate in the middle while in \"walker\" mode. The Hyena-class bomber is capable of carrying four proton bombs, six proton torpedoes and six concussion missiles inside the bomb bay beneath the hull. The Hyena bomber also carried two light laser cannons."

They were used prior to and during the Clone Wars, having the great advantage that if the ship was destroyed lives would be spared.

Several of these fighters are capable of ground-based locomotion and combat."
