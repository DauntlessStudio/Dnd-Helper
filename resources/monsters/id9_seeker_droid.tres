The body of ID9 seekers consistsd in a half-hemisphere dome with a red photoreceptor. Attached to that dome are five articulated, tentacle-like limbs that end in pincers. The ID9s are outfitted with electro-shock prods that allow them to harm organic lifeforms and incapacitate mechanical beings. They are capable of imitating the sounds of other droid models, and have two locomotions modes: hovering and crawling."

Tracker droids are not all dedicated tracking or probe droids as the name might suggest, but these are the most common types of droids to become linked with in most cultures throughout the galaxy, explaining this commonly used shorthand.
