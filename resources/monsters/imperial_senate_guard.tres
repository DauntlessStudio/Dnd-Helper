Stemming from the original Senate Guard of the Galactic Republic, the Imperial Senate Guard inherited the duty to protect senators and to accompany them as they traveled the galaxy. However, their true purpose is to ensure that the Imperial Senate remains loyal to Emperor Palpatine, the architect of the New Order. The Imperial Senate Guard's armor is blue-colored, and they are trained solely in melee combat, being equipped with cortosis staffs and personal energy shields that are powerful enough to deflect lightsaber attacks."
