flavorText = "The Emperor's Shadow Guard is an organization of elite, Force-sensitive soldiers.  Many suspect that they are former Jedi that have been captured, tortured, and brainwashed by Palpatine. They have been trained by Darth Vader. They were silent and enigmatic warriors that received orders directly from Emperor Palpatine himself and are often sent to eliminate suspected Jedi and other Force users.  The Shadow Guards command a great level of respect within the Empire's ranks and often lead quartets of Imperial Stormtroopers into battle against the Emperor's most hated foes. Shadow Guard members are often guarded by their own detail made up of Imperial Navy Commandos or stormtroopers, or in certain cases, members of the standard Royal Guard,"
