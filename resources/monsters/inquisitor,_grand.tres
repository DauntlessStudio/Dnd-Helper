The Emperor's apprentice Darth Vader soon discovered the program and was put in charge of them. Vader trained the Inquisitors in the ways of the dark side of the Force. As part of their training, a number of Inquisitors had parts of their body severed by Vader's lightsaber so that they would not forget the lesson of loss and to learn to abandon the tendency to fight defensively as former Jedi and adopt more offensive moves.Inquisitors also commanded Purge Troopers, which were elite death squads of clones. Due to the nature of their mission, Inquisitors had the power to commandeer any required Imperial Military forces, and all officers were to obey their orders. Any officer who came into contact with Force-sensitive beings was to immediately contact an Inquisitor to investigate the situation. Also, some Imperial officers disliked the interference of Inquisitors with some dismissing them as \"mystics.\" When the Inquisitors became part of the Inquisitorius, they left behind their former names and took up new names, with Brother or Sister denoting their sexes."
