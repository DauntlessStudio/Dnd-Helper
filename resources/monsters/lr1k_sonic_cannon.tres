The high impact concussive sonic energy is stabilized by a containment sphere within the cannon. The LR1K requires one or two gunners to operate, although the cannon's advanced, highly-precise targeting computers are capable of doing most of the work. A critical hit with this weapon will instantly kill any average clone."
