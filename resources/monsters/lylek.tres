With their spiked pincers and powerful mandibles with a pair of tentacles near it, the lyleks are the only Rylothian lifeform more dangerous than the predatory gutkurrs. Their ridged, spiked carapaces can deflect blaster bolts. Although the Lyleks live in hordes, the bigger individuals often dismember the smaller individuals of their kind. These hordes are led by a Lylek queen, and their elaborate underground nests can cover up to 15 square kilometers. They communicate by hissing, clicking and chittering. Their carapaces are tough enough to repel even heavy blaster fire, though a precisely aimed shot to the head can put one down."
