sectionText = "The narglatch is a stealthy, feline, apex predator which can be found in diverse environments, such as the Gungan swamps of Naboo or the frozen tundras of its native Orto Plutonia. Escaped narglatches are a threat on Coruscant.  The narglatch are considered to be sacred by the indigenous Talz, who use them as mounts and a source of food.***Biology & Appearance.*** The narglatch male had additional fleshy spikes, while females were smoother. They both had non-retractable claws and a fan-like tail that acted as a rudder during high-speed chases and turns. The narglatch also had densely padded feet that made for silent footfalls.A pregnant narglatch always gave birth to twins, one of each gender. Since young narglatch could hunt immediately upon birth, mothers abandoned them. ***Behavior.*** Cubs hunted together until maturity, making themselves less vulnerable to such Naboo creatures, as saw-toothed granks, veermoks, and even more mature male narglatch. As they approached maturity, the cubs separated.A solitary hunter, narglatch silently stalked and quickly killed its prey, usually kaadu or jimvu. Narglatch generally avoided deep water, although they were capable swimmers should the need arise. One of the few creatures they actively avoided were zalaacas."
