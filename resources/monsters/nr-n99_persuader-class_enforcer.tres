The impressive armament of the tank includes ion cannons and heavy repeating blasters, although this weapons package could be swapped out with alternative packages that included shock rifles or concussion missile launchers. The tank moves by way of its huge central tread, and it is augmented on either of its sides by forward-mounted outrigger wheels on a pontoon tread, which gives additional stability. Infantry soldiers are also able to ride on top of these tanks. The NR-N99 Persuader-class tank droid is able to move up to 40 mph, but this droid tank lacks the agility of walking droid tanks. It is also able to plow through battlefields and ram barricades. The droid is able to function through a variety of terrain, and the droid is also able to move on top of water. The NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer  is well-armored, possesses heat exchange panels and communications antennae, and the unit has armor-shielded photoreceptors. It was designed to be able to function with its computer brain, but the vehicle could also be controlled by a pilot droid."
