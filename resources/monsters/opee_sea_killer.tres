sectionText = "The opee sea killer, sometimes referred to as simply an opee, is a large meat-eating crustaceous sea creature of approximately 60 feet in length. A hybrid of crustacean and fish, the opee sea killer is indigenous to the watery planet core of Naboo. ***Biology.*** The opee is a predator often found clung to rocky outcroppings or hidden in caverns or under ledges awaiting its prey. When forced to move, the opee is perfectly adapted to swimï¿½in its own unusual wayï¿½sucking water into its mouth and jet propelling it from pores beneath armored plates at the rear of its body. This unique technique, coupled with three pairs of powerful legs and a pair of pectoral guidance fins, allows the opee to accelerate quickly underwater. Once in range of prey, the opee extends its massive adhesive tongue, successfully reeling in its prey to a vicious, gaping maw of multi-rowed teeth. The opee also uses the long, antennae-like stalks protruding from above its head as lures to draw prey towards its double rows of fangs. Their thick chitinous hide can deflect small arms laser fire, along with glancing shots from heavy fire.Opees are known to be mouth breeders, with the male opee carrying fertilized eggs inside its mouth for three monthsï¿½forcing the male to fast until the young are born. From birth, opees can sustain themselves instinctively (and gruesomely). It is not unknown for unhatched opee eggs to be swallowed by colo claw fish, creatures later killed in a grisly manner when the new-born young chew their way out of the colo's stomach. This can also occur if the colo swallows young opees alive.***Across the Galaxy.*** By unknown means, opees were introduced to Aquilaris, and can be seen swimming by the tunnels in which podraces take place.One opee sea killer is housed inside the Royal Icqui Aquaria, a large, public aquarium that is situated on the planet Coruscant, and the sea killer is the largest living creature in the facility."
