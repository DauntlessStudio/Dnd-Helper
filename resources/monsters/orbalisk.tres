sectionText = "Orbalisks are parasitic creatures native to Dxun. They lay inactive in caves or other dark places, until they find a suitable host creature on whose skin they can attach themselves to in order to feed. Orbalisks, once attached to a host, rapidly multiply, eventually enveloping and suffocating their victim. However, the holocron of Freedon Nadd contains the knowledge to make armament to prevent the orbalisks from covering the face, hands, and feet of the host, allowing them to keep this armor hidden.Perhaps by nature or as a result of residing on Dxun (which was itself a great focus of dark side power), orbalisks are able to feed on the Force-sensitivity of dark side wielders. It is said that the orbalisk armor's durability was such that lightsabers have a hard time penetrating it, making a wearer effectively immune to lightsaber attacks. The only weaknesses to this armor are the exposed joints at the neck and wrists, but these gaps are so small a lightsaber can only barely slice through. However, orbalisk armor is unable to protect the wearer from electricity. Orbalisks cause the wearer to feel pain, fueling the wearers dark side power; if they are removed or killed, they release a highly potent toxin into the host's body."
