sectionText = "Pelko bugs are small creatures that are covered in millions of microscopic barbs that deliver a paralytic, blistering toxin which can penetrate armor. They live only beneath sands of the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban, and are attracted to Force-sensitives. They stalk and swarm their prey in the darkness. The bug's attunement to the Force allows them to determine if a creature is suitable prey. The barbs are used in training sabers at the Sith Academy because of the toxin's effects, which mimick the effects of losing a limb to a lightsaber."
