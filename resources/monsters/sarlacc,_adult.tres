name = "Sarlacc, Adult"

sectionText = "The sarlacc is a large, immobile, omnivorous invertebrate with long tentacles that rim its mouth. There is some debate among xenobiologists as to whether the creature is a plant or animal, though most find the creature far too dangerous to merit an extended study of the question.***Biology.*** They reproduce by spores, known as \"sarlacci,\" that travel through space until they find another suitable planet to inhabit. After implanting itself into the ground, the sarlacci grow downward like a plant, forming a pit. The mouth and tentacles are the most visible parts of the sarlacc. The rest of the sarlacc's massive anatomical features are buried up to one hundred meters deep in the ground. This guarantees protection of the sarlacc's vital organs and makes it invulnerable to most forms of serious damage. The sarlacc's mouth is the only part of the body visible, usually. Most of its body is covered in rigid plates. It has eight appendages beneath the ground used for stability or for reburial if the sarlacc becomes partially exposed. The body of the sarlacc ends in three roots used for moisture absorption.These appendiges and roots are also used to sense the vibrations from nearby creatures. The sarlacc lacks eyes and ears, instead relying on the sensors in its roots to \"see\" its prey. ***Feeding.*** The teeth of the sarlacc surround its beak-like tongue and plant-like tentacles in tiers. Its teeth are also slightly slanted inward ensuring its prey remains trapped. Despite their size, the sarlacc does not need to eat much or often. While its lightning-fast tentacles are used to snatch up its prey, they are not its primary means of capturing a meal. The sarlacc discharges odors and scents that lure herbivores and scavengers close enough for it to use its tentacles. ***Digestion.*** After being swallowed by the tongue, the victim makes its way into the sarlacc's stomach to be digested, being kept alive and slowly digested for a millennium. A strong network of vessels inside the stomach punctures the victim's skin and muscles before injecting neurotoxins into them, preventing the victims from escaping and ensuring that they remain immersed in the acidic fluids in the stomach, and attached to the walls of the stomach. The vessels also provide victims with nutrients to keep them alive while they are digested in agony.A number of smaller, secondary stomachs are used to store victims for later consumption at times when the sarlacc needs larger amounts of nutrients, such as when it needs to grow, breed, or strengthen its tentacles and beak for catching stronger, larger prey. The secondary stomachs also function as a space to store victims when the main stomach runs out of room. The acidic fluids in the stomachs are composed of weak chemicals that take much longer to digest prey than acids in the stomach of other creatures.  The pain endured by its victims in this process was reputed to be unimaginable.  It is theorized that sarlaccs may be telepathic and may gain consciousness from the creatures they eat by assimilating their thoughts and memories during digestion.***Notable Examples.*** One of the known specimens of the species resides in the Great Pit of Carkoon, beneath the sands of the Dune Sea on the remote planet of Tatooine. Most sarlacci preferred damp environments, but they could live nearly anywhere including the desert sands of Tatooine.The largest known sarlacc in galactic history resides on the planet Felucia within the Ancient Abyss. It possessed massive tendrils and teeth that spread out over an area of the Abyss that was kilometers across."
