sectionText = "Starweirds are incorporeal, humanoid, Force-using creatures found only in the vacuum of space. ***Biology and Appearance.*** They are tall and extremely gaunt, wearing ephemeral rags that hang from their arms. Starweirds have long, wild white hair that floats around their heads, ignoring gravity. The creatures have pale skin and their faces are desiccated. Many witnesses state that the creature's face somewhat resembles their own. Starweirds each have a large, toothy mouth and eyes that glow. Their arms are bony and end in hands with three large, sharp, black talons. The species' incorporeal nature makes it possible for the creatures to resist conventional attacks and pass through solid objects, although force fields still stop the creatures. They are also fully affected by the use of the Force. Starweirds hover or fly silently instead of walking. While fairly intelligent, the creatures do not communicate and had no known language. They have no known ecological role, and after dying, a starweird leaves no traces of itself.***Behavior.*** Starweirds may appear to spacers repairing their damaged starship in deep space, or manifest aboard a ship traveling in hyperspace. Upon being spotted, starweirds become enraged and released a loud, piercing telepathic shriek. The creatures are noted for having a particular hatred for Force-sensitives, who they will mindlessly concentrate on killing even if there are other creatures present.Some Jedi hypothesize that they are physical manifestations of the dark side of the Force. However, there is little evidence to supported the theory."
