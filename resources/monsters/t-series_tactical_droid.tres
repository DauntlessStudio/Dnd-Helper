flavorText = "Super tactical droids are advanced tactical droids that had command capabilities during the Clone Wars, acting as generals of the Separatist Droid Army. They would often resort to threats and torture as interrogation routes. These droids were created to analyze a battle, calculate a possible battle-winning solution, and a time frame to carry out their plan. Being programmed with Separatist beliefs, they ruled through fear and through the lack of courage and hope in their victims and specifically \"freedom from the tyranny of the republic.\" Although Super Tactical Droids were not directly involved in combat, they were able to effectively use self-defense and an E-5 blaster rifle. Being programmed for success, they are willing to kill for the advancement of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.Building off their predecessors, the T-series tactical droid, they had a much more robotic inflection to their voices, as well a larger, more imposing and more damage-resistant body. These droids were also able to better process and adapt to sudden changes and unexpected complications and have more variables in their calculations. Although better than those before them, flaws in their programming were still prevalent. These included the difficulty to see approaches and plans that differ from their own, and the overconfidence in the Confederacy of Independent Systems and its army."
