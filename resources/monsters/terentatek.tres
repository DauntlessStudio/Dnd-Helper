sectionText = "Terentatek are creatures which feed off the blood of Force-sensitives, and inhabit caves and tombs strong with the dark side of the Force. ***Biology & Appearance.*** Terentateks resemble small rancors (approximately one-fourth the size of a fully-grown bull Rancor) with a number of spines growing from their backs and a pair of flaps, or tusk-like projections attached to their mouths. They also have four massive claws on each hand. Their tusks and claws are highly venomous. It is theorized that they were once rancors, subjected to mutations by the Sith, and that when the dark side is weak in the galaxy, they hibernate and remain dormant for many years, only to return when the dark side is strong again. A terentatek's hide is highly resistant - in some cases even immune - to the effects of the Force. They became the most dangerous of the creatures bred by the Sith, and were often dubbed Jedi Killers."
