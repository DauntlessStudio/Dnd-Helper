Garnac's scouts traveled to different worlds to collect other sentient beings to dump on Island Four, where the prisoners would be hunted for sport.Bossk, a famous Trandoshan bounty hunter, worked alongside fellow hunters Aurra Sing and Castas to mentor the orphaned Boba Fett. Bossk owned and operated a modified YV-666 light freighter named the Hound's Tooth. Bossk was renowned and feared for his effectiveness at killing Wookiees. He was ruthless and efficient, but upheld the Bounty Hunter Code and was known to keep his promises to the letter of the law. "
