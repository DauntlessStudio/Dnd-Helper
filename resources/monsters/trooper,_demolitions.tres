The Grand Army initially consisted of over a million clone troopers; genetically identical soldiers cloned from a human template, outfitted with armor, weapons and gear, and programmed for absolute loyalty to the Galactic Republic. Formed as a result of the Republic's efforts to create a centralized army in response to the threat of separatism, the Grand Army represented the evolution of galactic warfare at the time of its introduction on Geonosis, and was instrumental to the Sith Order's secret plot to take over the galaxy.***Imperial Army.*** As the ultimate evolution of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Imperial Army swiftly asserted dominance throughout the galaxy, making use of highly trained soldiers, mechanized walkers, and overwhelming numbers. The Imperial Army worked in tandem with the forces of the Imperial Navy, relying on the numerous fleets to transport legions of troopers across the far reaches of the galaxy. The most common soldiers of the Empire's ground forces were known as Imperial Army soldiers, the core infantry of the army tasked with establishing Imperial regimes and pacifying troublesome worlds. As the Imperials reinforced their grip on the galaxy, these units were gradually phased out in favor of stormtroopers, elite shock troops fanatically loyal to the Emperor himself.***First Order.*** The First Order army was the ground-based service branch of the First Order military. Formed from the Imperial Army of the Galactic Empire, it was responsible for maintaining order throughout First Order space as well as the gradual conquest and colonization of the Unknown Regions."
