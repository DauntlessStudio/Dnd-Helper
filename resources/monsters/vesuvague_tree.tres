It is one of a number of intelligent plants from the world, a category of which included the Bafforr tree.The vesuvague tree, though rooted in the earth, is able to detect and move itself towards motion by sensing air vibrations in its leaves and ground vibrations in its roots. In order to catch its prey, it uses its quickly growing vines and roots, capable of extending multiple meters in mere seconds, to seize, strangle, and crush its food. Once a creature is dead, the tree buries its vines and roots inside of its prey, and slowly feeds off of its bodily fluids.The tree can be trained to respond to simple commands, much like a pet, and can understand words by using its leaves to sense the vibrations and patterns of spoken languages."
