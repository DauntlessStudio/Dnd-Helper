sectionText = "Voxyn are a genetic cross between a fero xyn and a vornskrï¿½both deadly predatorsï¿½shaped into being by the sentient Yuuzhan Vong species. Designed to hunt and kill the Force-sensitive Jedi of the galaxy, the reptilian hounds are all clones of the voxyn queen.***Biology.*** The cells of voxyn deteriorate at a rapid rate if they are not exposed to a nutrient from the planet Myrkr, and as such, voxyn in other parts of the galaxy typically do not survive for more than a few months. Voxyn are naturally sterile.***Characteristics.*** Standing one meter high, mature voxyn measure over four meters in length and are reptilian in appearance, although warm-blooded. A pair of oval yellow eyes with excellent night vision are located on the voxyn's flattish head, which has a broad snout over six inches long filled with fangs, and its lithe body is covered in black or green scales and sports eight clawed legs. The toe pads house a hundred deadly retroviruses, whose medium is the green slime that covers the voxyn's claws.A series of sensory bristles covered in a powerful neurotoxin run down the creature's spine, ending in a whip-like tail that has a white, poisonous barb on it. The poison causes swelling and makes most creatures' flesh red for one to six days. The tail's barb can also be used to deliver a neural shock. Voxyn also have long, forked tongues and are able to shoot out of its mouth a jet of brown, acid-like saliva that burns anything it touches. The creatures can also emit a sonic blast from their snouts, sending a compression wave that can temporarily disable a person's hearing, make them feel nauseous, and shatter eardrums. Voxyn's purple blood, when exposed to air, becomes a neurotoxin that smells like smoke and ammonia. Voxyn are fast and agile on their feet, able to jump to great heights, and can swim in and under water. Voxyn possess the ability to sense Force-sensitives through the Force. Jedi can sometimes feel voxyn as well, registering the creatures as a hungry or feral presence. However, voxyn can hide their presence from Force-sensitives."
