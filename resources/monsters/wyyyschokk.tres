When attacking, they immobilize their victims with thick strands of web and copious amounts of poisonous fluid from their upraised mandibles.***Range.*** While most wyyyschokk live deep in the lower levels of the wroshyr forests, some populations can also be found in the Etyyy region where no kilometer-high forests grow, while others live in the ShadowWeave Caverns in the Kkowir Forest."
