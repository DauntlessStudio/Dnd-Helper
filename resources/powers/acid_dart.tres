description = "A shimmering green dart streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the dart splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd."
