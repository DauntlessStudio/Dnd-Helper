description = "You exude an aura out to 5 feet that boosts the morale and overall battle prowess of you and your allies while simultaneously reducing the opposition's combat-effectiveness by eroding their will to fight. 

Whenever you or a friendly creature within your meditation makes an attack roll or a saving throw, they can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw. 

Whenever a hostile creature enters your meditation or starts its turn there, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from each attack roll or saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. On a successful save, it is immune to this power for 1 day."
