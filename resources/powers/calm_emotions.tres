description = "You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

- You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this power ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime. 
- You can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a power or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. 

When the power ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise."
