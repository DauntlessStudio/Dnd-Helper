description = "You generate an explosion of cryogenic energy in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see 

within range. Each creature in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 + 20 cold damage and is restrained for 1 minute as it is encased in carbonite. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is restrained until the end of its next turn. 

As an action, a restrained creature can make a Strength check against your tech save DC, ending this effect on itself on a success.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this power dies instantly, as its body shatters into frozen chunks."
