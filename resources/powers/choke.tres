description = "You make a constricting gesture at a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save target takes 5d8 force damage and is restrained until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and is not restrained.

You can use a bonus action while the target is restrained to move the target up to 5 feet in any direction.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd."
