description = "You scatter a large number of caltrops across ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range. These caltrops pierce deep into the feet and boots of anyone who walks upon them. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 kinetic damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The caltrops are nearly invisible to the naked eye. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the power is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your tech save DC to notice the caltrops before entering the area."
