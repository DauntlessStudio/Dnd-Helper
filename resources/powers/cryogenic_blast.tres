description = "You release a shard of cryogenic energy at one creature within range. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 kinetic damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st."
