description = "A blast of cold air erupts from you. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.

A creature killed by this power becomes frozen in carbonite.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th."
