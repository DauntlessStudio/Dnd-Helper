description = "A storm of cryogenic energy encompasses the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The storm's area of effect becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 5th level or higher, the kinetic damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th."
