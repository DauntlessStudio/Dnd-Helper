description = "A wave of cold energy spreads out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage, and suffers no additional effect.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. At 3rd level or above, a creature gains 2 slowed levels on a failed save. At 5th level or above, a creature gains 3 slowed levels on a failed save. At 7th level or above, a creature gains 4 slowed levels on a failed save."
