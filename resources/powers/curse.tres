The first time each turn a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the power ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. When you cast this power at 3rd, 6th, or 9th level, the die increases to d6, d8, and d10, respectively."
