description = "Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and can't take reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a power slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st."
