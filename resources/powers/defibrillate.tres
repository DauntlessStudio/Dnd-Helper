description = "You touch a creature that has died within the last minute and administer a shock to restore it to life. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This power can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival�its head, for instance�the power automatically fails. Once this power has restored a creature to life, it cannot benefit from this power again until it finishes a short or long rest."
