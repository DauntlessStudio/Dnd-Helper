description = "Make a ranged tech attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 ion damage. Additionally, if the target has tech points, it must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it loses 5 tech points, as though it expended a tech slot.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power with a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the ion damage increases by 1d8, and the amount of tech points lost increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd."
