description = "One constructed object up to 100 lbs. in weight that you touch falls to pieces, separating into its component parts. For instance, a vibrosword separates into a blade, handle, oscillator, and guard, while a hovercart collapses into a repulsor engine, bolts, and metal panels. If the object is being worn, carried, or operated by a creature, the creature can make an Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the item is unaffected."
