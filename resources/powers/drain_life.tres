description = "You draw the life force from a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you reduce a hostile creature to 0, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th."
