If it fails, the first time on each turn when it takes damage of the chosen type, it takes an extra 2d6 damage of it. The target also loses resistance to the type until the power ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them."
