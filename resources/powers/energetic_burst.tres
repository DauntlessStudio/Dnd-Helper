***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power with a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the target gains 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 2nd. When you cast this power at 4th level or higher, the die size increases for every two slot levels above 2nd (d6 at 4th level, d8 at 6th level, d10 at 8th level)."
