description = "You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for the duration. A target with 25 hit points or fewer makes the saving throw with disadvantage. A frightened creature can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success. This power has no effect on constructs or droids."
