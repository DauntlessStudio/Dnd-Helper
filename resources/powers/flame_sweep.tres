description = "A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st."
