description = "When you cast this power, you raise your hand and unleash a burst of Force energy. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and, if it is Large or smaller, is also pushed back 5 feet. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. All Medium or smaller objects that are not worn or carried within the area of effect are also pushed 5 feet.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. For each slot 2 levels higher than 1st, you can add an additional 5 feet to the push."
