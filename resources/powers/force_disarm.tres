description = "You select a weapon or object being worn or carried by a Large or smaller creature within range. The creature must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the creature chooses the ability to use). If the item is being carried, this save is made with advantage. On a failed save, the item is pulled directly to you. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet."
