description = "You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 4d8+15 hit points. For the duration of the power, the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).

If the creature has a severed part you hold it to the stump, the power instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.

This power has no effect on droids or constructs."
