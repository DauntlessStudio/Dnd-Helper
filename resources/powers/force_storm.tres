description = "A crackling storm of lightning with a diameter of 60 feet and a height of 120 feet appears in a location you choose within range. Whenever a creature enters the storm or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 30d6 lightning damage or half as much as a successful one.

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried."
