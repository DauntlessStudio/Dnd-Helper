description = "You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall unconscious for the power's duration. The power ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this power again until it finishes a long rest. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd."
