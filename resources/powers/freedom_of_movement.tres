description = "You touch a willing creature. Its movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and powers and enhanced effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be paralyzed or restrained.

The target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from unenhanced restraints. Additionally, being underwater imposes no penalties on its movement or attacks. "
