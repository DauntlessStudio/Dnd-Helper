description = "You make a vine sprout from the ground in an unoccupied space you can see. When you cast this power, you can make the vine whip a creature up to 30 feet from it, if you can see the target. The creature must pass a Dexterity save or be pulled 20 feet directly toward the vine.

Until the power ends, you can use your bonus action to have the vine lash out again."
