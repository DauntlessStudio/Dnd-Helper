description = "A 5-foot diameter sphere of compressed lightning appears in an unoccupied space of your choice and lasts for the duration. Each creature within 5 feet of the sphere when the power is cast must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the ball of lightning up to 30 feet vertically or horizontally. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d8 kinetic damage (or half as much damage on a success), and the sphere stops moving this turn. A creature takes half as damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 6th level or higher, both the lightning and kinetic damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th."
