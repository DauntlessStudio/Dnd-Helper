The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the power ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the power ends. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force power slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th."
