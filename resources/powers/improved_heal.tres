description = "A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th."
