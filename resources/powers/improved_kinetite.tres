description = "A 20-foot-radius sphere of compressed lightning springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the power’s duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 kinetic damage. The sphere’s space is difficult terrain.

Until the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged force attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.

Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases for each of its effects by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th."
