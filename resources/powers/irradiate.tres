description = "A surge of radiation washes over a creature within range. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage and suffers one level of exhaustion, which lasts for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature exhausted by this power can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the power ends.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd."
