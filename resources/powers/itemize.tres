description = "You instantly learn the exact quantity of one type of item within 30 feet of you. It must be a type of item that you've handled in the past; you can't, for example, use *itemize* to find out how many *BKGs* are nearby if you've never handled such a weapon. The object being itemized must also be reasonably specific. You can learn how many meilooruns are nearby, for example, but not how much fruit."
