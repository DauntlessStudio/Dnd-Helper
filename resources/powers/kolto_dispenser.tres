description = "You establish a mobile first aid station that radiates kolto in a 5-foot cube you can see within range.

Until the power ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the station's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the station to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The station can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your techcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the station disintegrates. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the station up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd."
