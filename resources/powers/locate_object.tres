If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement. The power can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it while within 30 feet of it. Alternatively, the power can locate the nearest object of a particular kind. This power can't locate an object if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path between you and the object."
