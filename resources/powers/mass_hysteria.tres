description = "Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, manifesting their worst nightmares as an implacable threat visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere is frightened for the duration of the power. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 5d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the power ends for that creature. This power has no effect on droids or constructs."
