description = "You emit a cacophonous scream imbued with the power of the Force. Each creature you choose within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 psychic damage, 6d6 sonic damage, is deafened and blinded for 1 minute, and knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't deafened, blinded, or knocked prone.

A creature blinded by this power makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded."
