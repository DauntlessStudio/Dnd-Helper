description = "This ability repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn strap, or a leaking cup. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. If you target a droid or construction with this feature, it can spend and roll one of its Hit Dice and regain that many hit points."
