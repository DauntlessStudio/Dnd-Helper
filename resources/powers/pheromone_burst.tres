Each creature within range other than you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage and become frightened of you until the start of its next turn. A creature that is immune to the poisoned condition is not frightened.

This power's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4)."
