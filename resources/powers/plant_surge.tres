description = "If you cast this power using 1 action, all normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on a point become overgrown. Moving through the area spends 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved. You can exclude areas of any size within the power's area from being affected.

If you cast this power over 8 hours, all plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested for 1 year."
