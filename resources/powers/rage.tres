description = "You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by the Force. Until the power ends, you can't cast powers, and you gain the following benefits:

- You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the power ends, they are lost.
- You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with lightweapons and vibroweapons.
- When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra 2d12 force damage.
- You have proficiency with all armor, lightweapons, and vibroweapons.
- You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.

Immediately after the power ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion."
