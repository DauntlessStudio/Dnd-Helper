description = "You move in a burst of speed to deliver a deadly blow. When you cast this power, you must be wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, otherwise, the power fails. As part of the action used to cast this power, you move in a straight line to an unoccupied space within the power's range and strike a creature within your weapon's range. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement have disadvantage. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage equal to three rolls of the weapon's damage dice + 4d4 force damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd."
