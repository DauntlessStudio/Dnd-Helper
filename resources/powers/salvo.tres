description = "You launch three projectiles at points you can see within range. Each creature within a 10-foot radius sphere of each point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire and 3d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one sphere is affected only once.

The power damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 6th level or higher, you create four projectiles. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 8th level or higher, you create five projectiles."
