description = "Until the power ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack, a harmful power, or a hostile action must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or power. This power doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects.

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a power that affects an enemy creature, or takes a hostile action this power ends."
