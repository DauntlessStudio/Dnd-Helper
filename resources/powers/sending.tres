description = "You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar that possesses a commlink. The creature hears the message, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. 

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planets, but if the target is on a different planet than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive."
