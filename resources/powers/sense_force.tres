If you sense the Force in this way, you can use your action to determine the direction from which it originates and, if it's in line of sight, you see a faint aura around the person or object from which the Force emanates.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a 3rd-level force slot, the range increases to 60 feet. When you use a 5th-level force slot, the range increases to 500 feet. When you use a 7th-level force slot, the range increases to 1 mile. When you use a 9th-level force slot, the range increases to 10 miles."
