description = "Your power with the Force deepens a creature's understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the power ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill.

You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn't already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus."
