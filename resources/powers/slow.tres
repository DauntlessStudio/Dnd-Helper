description = "A hostile creature of your choice must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains 1 slowed level until the power ends. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

This power can affect multiple targets when you reach higher levels: two targets at 5th level, three targets at 11th level, and four targets at 17th level. "
