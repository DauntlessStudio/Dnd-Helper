description = "You cause thick smoke to erupt from a point within range, filling a 20-foot-radius sphere. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the smoke cloud increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st."
