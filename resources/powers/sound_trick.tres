description = "You use the Force to produce an effect within range. You create one of the following special effects within range:
- Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal, and you can alter its tone, for 1 minute.
- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
- You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a bird, or ominous whispers.
- You gain the ability to speak like another species for 1 minute, allowing you to speak in a language you know but otherwise lack the physical ability to speak, such as a Wookiee speaking Basic.
- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, a billowing of someone's clothes, or a flickering of unenhanced light fixtures within range.

A wary creature can use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force save DC, discerning that the effects are illusory on a success.

If you cast this power multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action."
