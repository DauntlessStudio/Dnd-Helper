description = "You fire an undulating, warbling bolt of energy at a creature within range. Make a ranged tech attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attacks damage type, as shown below.

| d8  | Damage Type |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | Acid |
|  2  | Cold |
|  3  | Fire |
|  4  | Energy |
|  5  | Ion |
|  6  | Lightning |
|  7  | Poison |
|  8  | Sonic |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the bolt leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the bolt to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this power.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st."
