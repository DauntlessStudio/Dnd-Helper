description = "You touch a willing creature, granting it an elemental charge. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or sonic. For the duration, a creature can use an action to expel energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd."
