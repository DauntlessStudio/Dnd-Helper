description = "You choose a creature you can see within range and mark it as your quarry. Until the power ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, the target gains no benefit from one-quarter, half, and three-quarters cover against you, and if the target is invisible, you can see it as if it were visible. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this power ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 8 hours. When you use a tech slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 24 hours."
