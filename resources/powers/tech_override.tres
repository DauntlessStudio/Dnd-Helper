description = "You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a tech power. If the creature is casting a power of 3rd level or lower, its power fails and has no effect. If it is casting a power of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your techcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the power's level. On a success, the creature's power fails and has no effect.

***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted power has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the tech slot you used."
