description = "A beam of Force energy flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. 

You can create a new telekinetic gust as your action on your turn until the power ends.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 6th."
