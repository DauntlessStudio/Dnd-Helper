description = "You manipulate the Force in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 force damage, is knocked prone, and moved 5 feet in a direction of your choice. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or moved.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 9th level, the damage increases by 2d6."
