If you choose three creatures, each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 energy damage. If you choose two creatures, each target takes 1d6 energy damage on a failed save instead. If you choose only one creature, the target takes 1d8 energy damage on a failed save.

This power's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (two dice), 11th level (three dice), and 17th level (four dice)."
