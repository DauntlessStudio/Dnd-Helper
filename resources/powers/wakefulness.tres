description = "You use the Force to control your body's functions. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore the effects of any levels of exhaustion you have. 
- You do not need to eat, drink, or sleep. You can't be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such as reading and keeping watch. 

If you still have any levels of exhaustion when this power ends, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain one additional level of exhaustion."
